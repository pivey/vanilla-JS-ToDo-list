A vanilla JS toDo list project using local storage for state management to allow me to develop my understanding of pure JS and play with some basic CSS styles and conventions such as BEM and SMACSS. 

Additions for the future: 

- redo this project using React or vue
- add Yup validation for the front end to validate input from users
- use a JSON server database / mongoDB to store state so not to rely on local storage.
